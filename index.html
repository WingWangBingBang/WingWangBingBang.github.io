    <h1>1950s Rock</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>People used music to protest civil rights. New styles that would be considered “unusual” were used to question the
      current ideologies of society. The USA started new wars like the Vietnam War and the Korean War caused the people to
      demand world peace and stop all wars.</p>
    <p>
      Peace was a very common theme in rock, which led to many movements about keeping peace in the world. Many songs were made to protest the current society.

      Rock helped society include african-american people and influenced many protests against what the current society did.

    <p>Rock and Roll was developed from rhythm and blues. It first emerged from the United States in the 1950s. It is a
      genre of popular music. It is very energetic with insightful lyrics. It is characterised by its drums and loud
      guitars. It celebrated themes like freedom and peace during the 1950s. Rock and roll was controversial because
      people were afraid of race mixing because of racism back then.</p>
